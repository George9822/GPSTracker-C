# GPS Tracker
It's a GPS tracker made in C with the help of files, pointers, and algorithms, in which a trilateration of distance is made of a system based on 3 satellites, representing a graph. 

For this satellite system, there may be N locations that can be computed and which represent certain coordinates for all N points, but to solve the proposed problem, the shortest distance from the starting point to the desired point of arrival is calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm.
